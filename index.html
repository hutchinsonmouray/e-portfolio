                    <p>Through this experience that it is always necessary to double check your assumptions and listen before you think you know something. Whether it was in the work environment, ordering at restaurants or simply crossing the street, there is always a lesson in how others are navigating a situation that you are in. For that reason, my main takeway and piece of advice is no matter where you are going and what you are doing, listen to the people around you and make informed and accurate decisions. Similarly, always be open to new insights.  </p>

                    <div class="text">Have realistic expectations</div>
                    <p>When studying abroad you are getting used to new people, a new enviornment and you may also be utlizing technical or professional skills that you have not used in a while. Therefore, be realistic in what you expect from yourself and other. As Dr.Thomas always says, "underpromise and over deliver." For Cape Town specifically, research good safety and cultural norms and do not expect it to be as comfortable as home in certain capacities. That being said, expect for Cape Town to surpass your expections in other areas because it is an amazing city! </p>
